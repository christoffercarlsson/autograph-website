# Documentation

## [Specification](/docs/specification)

This document describes the Autograph protocol. The protocol allows one party
(”Bob”) to cryptographically verify any type of data from another party
(”Alice”) based on public keys and signatures from trusted third parties (e.g.
”Charlie”). It also allows Alice and Bob to establish a shared secret key for
future communication. Autograph provides cryptographic deniability and forward
secrecy.
